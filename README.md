# Three-Reel-Slot

/\*
Hello and welcome to your 1 523'rd work assignment!

    Today we are going to make a 3 reel slot that starts, spins and stops.
    And if we are lucky enough to land the same symbol on all 3 reels, we win! WOHO!

    * Reels should start, spin and stop on random positions/symbols
    * If all 3 reels stops on the same symbol, play a win celebration.
    * You can use the WinsweepBox[00-25] sequence for win animation.
    * All available symbols can be found within assets.json

    The assignment will be judged with the following points in mind:
    * Creativity
    * Structure
    * Complexity
    * Look'n'feel

    Spritesheets can be created from https://www.codeandweb.com/tp-online
    Example on how to get started with sprites can be found in the run() method.
